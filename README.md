* Instructor Q\&A support
* Updates to course materials
* Discounts on future courses

## 🎯 Who This Is For

This project and course are perfect for:

* Beginners learning full-stack development
* Students building a web development portfolio
* Intermediate developers interested in social platforms
* Anyone preparing for tech interviews or internships

No prior experience in PHP or MySQL is necessary—concepts are introduced from the ground up.

## 📌 Notes

> Some techniques used (like procedural MySQLi) are chosen for teaching clarity and simplicity. Learners are encouraged to adapt or refactor with modern practices such as PDO or ORM frameworks (e.g., Laravel) as they grow.

## 🧠 Fun and Portfolio-Ready

The final product is not just a learning exercise—it’s a fully functioning social network that’s impressive to employers and fun to build. It’s a standout project for your resume or portfolio!
